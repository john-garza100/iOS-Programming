print(1 == 1)	// Equal to, true because 1 is equal to 1
print(2 != 1)	// Not Equal to, true because 2 is not equal to 1
print(2 > 1)	// Greater than, true because 2 is Greater than 1
print(1 < 2)	// Less than, true because 1 is Less than 2
print(1 >= 1)	// Greater than or Equal to, true because 1 is Greater than or Equal to 1
print(2 <= 1)	// Less than or Equal to, false because 2 is Not Less than or Equal to 1

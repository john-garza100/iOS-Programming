// Introducing Conditionals
// 1. Choosing between different room type at a hotel.
//		The room price for bigger room would be higher.
// 2. Switching between different payment methods at an online store.
//		Procedures for different payment methods would be different.
// 3. Deciding what to order at a fast-food restaurant.
//		Preparation procedures for each food item would be different.

// Using if statements

// if condition {
//		code
// }

// If statements execute code in curly braces if the condition is true
let isPictureVisible = true
// if the value is changed to false nothing would be printed
if isPictureVisible {
	print("Picture is visible")
}

// isRestaurantFound == false returns true, so the print statement is executed
let isRestaurantFound = false
// if the value is changed to true nothing would be printed
if isRestaurantFound == false {
	print("Restaurant was not found")
}

// if-else statement. Code after the else keyword is executed if the condition is false
let drinkingAgeLimit = 21
var customerAge = 19
// Experiment by changing the customer age to a value greater than 21
if customerAge < drinkingAgeLimit {
	print("Under age limit")
} else {
	print("Over age limit")
}
